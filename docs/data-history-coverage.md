# Data history coverage

This page is the current source of truth for retained traffic history while the
broader data documentation is being reworked.

## Corridor samples

The retention job moves expired `traffic_sample` rows into
`traffic_sample_archive`. Archive-inclusive views keep those scalar corridor
samples available to history and analytics queries.

## Speed-zone samples

Migration `V24` makes `traffic_speed_zone_sample` durable instead of deleting
zone observations when their parent corridor sample moves into the archive.
The existing `sample_id` remains a logical reference:

- while a sample is live, it matches `traffic_sample.id`;
- after retention, it matches `traffic_sample_archive.source_id`.

Detailed zone history cannot be reconstructed for rows deleted before this
change. On August 31, 2026, before the migration was deployed, the earliest
verified zone observation still present was
`2026-08-01T02:15:32.148388Z`. The exact durable coverage start is the oldest
row remaining when `V24` reaches production and must be recorded here after
deployment.

Use this query after deployment to confirm and record that boundary:

```sql
select min(polled_at) as zone_history_coverage_started_at,
       max(polled_at) as latest_zone_observation_at,
       count(*) as retained_zone_rows
from traffic_speed_zone_sample;
```

The table deliberately has no foreign key to only one side of the live/archive
split. Its `sample_id` index still supports joining either storage tier.

## Local map flow cells

Migrations `V25` and `V26` add the map's half-mile flow-cell read model. The
current tables replace each corridor snapshot in place; they are current state,
not minute-by-minute history. The hourly table keeps one aggregate per UTC hour,
corridor, cell, and available direction with no automatic time cutoff.

This local map history begins when the migrations and writer reach production.
It is not reconstructed from older corridor or speed-zone summaries because
those rows do not preserve the source paths needed for truthful short-stretch
values. Older dashboard views must continue to show local flow as unavailable.

After deployment, record the exact first retained hour here using:

```sql
select min(hour_start) as map_history_coverage_started_at,
       max(hour_start) as latest_map_history_hour,
       count(*) as retained_map_history_rows
from traffic_flow_cell_hourly;
```

Current-state continuity can be checked separately without treating it as
history:

```sql
select corridor, observed_at, status, supported_cell_count, total_cell_count
from traffic_flow_cell_snapshot
order by corridor;
```
